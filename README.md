# Screeps
Creating an AI to play Screeps using JavaScript

I have very minimal experience with JavaScript, however this game has been helping me learn my way around it. I started in on room with no buildings and a spawner.
Now (10/31/2020) I have two self-sufficient rooms with defense mechanisms and the ability to continue working even if I step away from the game. I believe these
screeps would last for months without me looking over them now. I am very confident in my code and even if were to get raided and lose everything, they would be 
able to repopulate the rooms and build from the ground up.
